# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## My Goal

The objective of this challenge is to solidify what I learn't in the Dicee tutorial. This app will guide me through the steps required to build an 8 ball app and I will be applying what I have learnt about Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I will create

I am going to make a magical 8 ball app, it will give you the answers to all the tricky questions in life.
